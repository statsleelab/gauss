  interval = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{input_file}{file name of input data containing rsid, chr, bp, a1, a2, and z}

\item{reference_index_file}{file name of reference panel index data}

\item{reference_data_file}{file name of reference panel data}

\item{reference_pop_desc_file}{file name of reference panel population description data}

\item{interval}{stepping distance within the SNP vector for selecting the first SNP of each pair.}

\item{offset}{distance between the two SNPs in a pair}
}
\value{
R data frame containing population IDs and weights
}
\description{
ZMIX4 employs a more selective approach by using a fixed offset to 
determine the SNP pairs. For instance, if the offset is set to 3 and 
the interval is specified as 1000, the function will pair the first SNP 
(SNP_0) with the fourth one (SNP_3), then SNP_1000 with SNP_1003, and so forth. 
In subsequent iterations, this pattern continues in a similar manner - 
SNP_1 gets paired with SNP_4, SNP_1001 with SNP_1004, and so on, 
effectively creating pairs at specific intervals with a consistent offset.
