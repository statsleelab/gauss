prep_zmix2(
  input_file,
  reference_index_file,
  reference_data_file,
  reference_pop_desc_file,
  interval = NULL,
  offset = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_file}{file name of input data containing rsid, chr, bp, a1, a2, and z}

\item{reference_index_file}{file name of reference panel index data}

\item{reference_data_file}{file name of reference panel data}

\item{reference_pop_desc_file}{file name of reference panel population description data}

\item{interval}{stepping distance within the SNP vector for selecting the first SNP of each pair.}

\item{offset}{distance between the two SNPs in a pair}
}
\value{
R data frame containing population IDs and weights
}
\description{
Interval and Offset Logic: Instead of considering all pairwise combinations, 
zmix2 selects SNP pairs based on a fixed offset. For example, if offset is 3 and
and interval is 1000, it pairs SNP_0 with SNP_3, SNP_1000 with SNP_1003 ...
Reduced Pairing Scope: This approach reduces the total number of SNP pairs 
considered compared to zmix, focusing on pairs separated by a specific distance 
(offset) in the SNP vector.
