# GAUSS

GAUSS (Genome Analysis Using Summary Statistics) is a versatile R
package designed for the analysis of multi-ethnic GWAS summary
statistics. It leverages a large multi-ethnic reference panel consisting
of 32,953 genomes ([33KG
Panel](https://statsleelab.github.io/gauss/articles/ref_33KG.html)),
including 20,281 Europeans, 10,800 East Asians, 522 South Asians, 817
Africans, and 533 Native Americans. The GAUSS package offers a robust
set of tools that enable researchers to: i) accurately estimate the
ancestry proportions within a multi-ethnic GWAS
([`afmix()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/afmix.md)
and `zimx()`), ii) calculate ancestry-informed linkage disequilibrium
(LD) metrics
([`computeLD()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/computeLD.md)),
iii) impute Z-scores for genetic variants not originally measured
([`dist()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/dist.md) and
[`distmix()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/distmix.md)),
iv) conduct in-depth transcriptome-wide association studies
([`jepeg()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/jepeg.md)
and
[`jepegmix()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/jepegmix.md)),
and v) apply corrections for the ‘Winner’s Curse’ biases
([`fiqt()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/fiqt.md)).

## Pre-installation

GAUSS no longer requires the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). Installation
only needs standard R tooling plus the package dependencies.

## GAUSS Installation

You can install the development version of gauss from GitHub with:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("statsleelab/gauss")
```

## Suggested Workflow

![](reference/figures/GAUSS_Flowchart_bioinfo.png)

GAUSS functions utilize five core input datasets: i) Association Z-score
Data (highlighted in blue), consisting of six columns of variables: SNP
ID (rsid), chromosome number (chr), base pair position (bp), reference
allele (a1), alternative allele (a2), and Z-score (z); ii) Allele
Frequency Data (colored in red), encapsulating rsid, chr, bp, a1, a2,
and reference allele frequency (af1); iii) Ethnic Mixing Proportion Data
(colored in green), comprising population name abbreviations and
corresponding mixing proportions; iv) SNP Annotation Data (colored in
orange), offering functional annotation information of SNPs; v)
Reference Panel Data (colored in yellow), e.g., [33KG
Panel](https://statsleelab.github.io/gauss/articles/ref_33KG.html)
offering genotype information for a significant pool of 32,953
individuals from 29 diverse ethnic groups.

Initially, users should determine whether their input summary statistics
data originate from mixed ethnicity cohorts. If they do not (suggesting
the data comes from a homogeneous cohort), users can use a variety of
analysis functions specific to homogeneous cohorts, including
[`computeLD()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/computeLD.md)
for LD estimation,
[`dist()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/dist.md) for
imputing Z-scores of missing SNPs, and
[`jepeg()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/jepeg.md) for
conducting trascriptome-wide associaton study (TWAS). These functions
primarily require Association Z-score Data and Reference Panel Data.

Conversely, if the data derive from mixed ethnicity cohorts and the
ethnic mixing proportions are known, GAUSS provides a range of tools for
multi-ethnic cohort analysis. These encompass
[`computeLD()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/computeLD.md)
for LD estimation,
[`distmix()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/distmix.md)
for Z-score imputation, and
[`jepegmix()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/jepegmix.md)
for TWAS. These tools require Association Z-score Data, Reference Panel
Data, and Mixing Proportion Data. If ethnic mixing proportions are not
known, they should be estimated using either the
[`afmix()`](https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss/reference/afmix.md)
function (if Allele Frequency Data is available) or the `zmix()`
function (if it is not). Upon determining the ethnic mixing proportions,
users can apply the genome analysis functions designed for multi-ethnic
cohorts.

Small colored squares on arrows pointing to GAUSS functions denote the
required input data sets for each function. For instance, an arrow
pointing to the afmix() function is marked by two colored squares (red
and yellow), indicating that this function utilizes both Allele
Frequency Data and Reference Panel Data as inputs.
